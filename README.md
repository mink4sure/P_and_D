## PDM
The code in this repository is the code for the project... blablabal

It is spilt up into two main sections: The working code, which has an MPC for
local motion planning and a PID for control of the drone and the not so working
code. The not working code is an attempt at full a MPC for a drone, but due to
the complex dynamics, we have hit a little snag. 

**For the working code see branch: MAIN**
